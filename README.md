# Steam Bot #

Implements an automated Steam trading bot using the Steam APIs. I only implemented this for fun and am not using it for anything so don't expect this to be mantained in the future unless someone wants to contribute.

**Features:**

 * Supports multiple accounts
 * Auto-crafting
 * No dependencies on the Steam DLLs

**Build:**

1. Update the Git submodules (Newtonsoft.Json)
2. Open SteamBot.sln 
3. Edit SteamBot/Program.cs to add your own Steam web key and accounts.
4. Build and enjoy.
